/**
 * Records changes to state objects that are registered via [startTrackingState] (or
 * [trackStateHistory]) and allows restoring state to previous values.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ### Simple
 *
 * 1. Wrap your composition in [WithStateHistory].
 * 2. Call [MutableState.trackStateHistory] on the states you want to track. (See also
 *  [SnapshotStateList.trackStateHistory], [SnapshotStateMap.trackStateHistory].)
 * 3. Call [StateHistory.undo] to undo changes.
 *
 * ### Advanced
 *
 * 1. Create an instance of this that will live across recompositions (e.g. use remember or store
 *  near the top of your DI object graph).
 * 1. Provide the instance to your composition through the [LocalStateHistory] composition local.
 * 1. Call [recordChanges] from a coroutine to start recording changes. To save a new history frame
 *  every time some state changes are applied, pass a callback that calls [saveFrame].
 * 1. Register states you want to track with [startTrackingState]. Make sure to call
 *  [stopTrackingState] when finished with the state object to allow it to be garbage-collected.
 *  If creating the state directly in a composition (e.g. with [remember]), you can also pass the
 *  state object to [trackStateHistory] to automatically stop tracking it when it leaves the
 *  composition.
 * 1. Call [setCurrentFrameGlobally] to restore the state of all tracked objects to the states they
 *  had at the given frame, or call the convenience methods [undo]/[redo] to move the frame by one.
 *
 * E.g.:
 * @sample WithStateHistory
